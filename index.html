 	    <p>Hi everyone, this is Noemie, nice to know you, I am french chinese and I'm currently a 1st year student at ESSEC Business School in France. I love music and good water sportsüí¶! Welcome to my page:)</p>
 	    <a href="https://www.essec.edu/en/"target= "_blank">Here is a link to check out my uni!</a>

 		<h2>About me!</h2>
        <p>So, here's the scoop: I was born in Hong Kong and spent my first 15 years living it up in China. Then, I decided to shake things up a bit and headed to a boarding school in the UK. Three years of IB later (thank goodness that's done!), and now I find myself at a French business school - who would've thought, right? Thanks to these experiences, I am fluent in three languages (make it four if you count Cantonese, like I do, haha). I'm currently grappling with Italian in school, but I can't quite call myself fluent yet. Anyways, I'm all about hanging out with my family and friends, and trust me, getting to know me will be quite interesting. So, keep on scrollingüòè</p>

    	<h2>What do I Like the MOST?</h2>
        <p>TRAVELL! Maybe it's because of my background, but I've always had this itch to dive into different cultures and experiences. That's why I signed up for the IBEA Program - every semester, I get to jet off to a new country! Germany, Singapore, the US, Brazil... sounds pretty cool, right? Can't wait to see what each place will bring to me :) </p>

    	<p> If going around is like breathing for me, capturing those moments through the lens of my camera is my way of preserving those memories forever. So, if you want to see the world through my eyes, make sure to give my digicam account on Instagram a follow.</p>
